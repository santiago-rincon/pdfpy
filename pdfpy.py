    SPLIT A PDF FILE\n

    [*] "2,3,4,5" or "2:5" (splits pages 2 to 5).\n
    [*] "2,5:10,15" (splits page 2, page 5 to 10 and page 15).\n
    [*] "2:2:10" (splits pages 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10).\n
    [*] "1:5:21" (splits pages 1, 6, 11, 16, 21).\n
    [*] "5:" (splits from page 5 to the end of the document)\n
